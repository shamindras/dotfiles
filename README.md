# Personal dotfiles

**Warning:** _these dotfiles are currently a work in progress (not yet complete).
Feel free to take Inspiration from them, but best not to use them as is._

This is a repo of my personal dotfiles for `macOS`. The main philosophy is to
use

- A [modern unix](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix) workflow.
- The [`XDG`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_user_directories) directory specification.
